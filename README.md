This is the course project of COMS-W4115 Programming Language and Translator.

It is contributed by Tong Ge, Jingsi Li and Shuo Yang.

We design a music language called Melody, and use the OCaml to build a translator for it.

To compile the scanner.mll, ast.mli and parser.mly, and test the conflicts, simply run compile_script.
